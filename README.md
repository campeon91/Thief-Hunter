#Code Name : Thief Hunter

By : Fahmi Ghediri - Souhail Degachi - Fahd Youssef

Thief Hunter is a project designed and implemented by three tunisian students in computer Science engineering ( ENSI Tunisia ).
It's mainly an anti-theft solution for laptops by geolocating thieves, but includes also the possibilities to secure personal data
and collect as much informations as possible from the stolen machine. 

The idea was proposed for the first time in Tunisia by Fahmi Ghediri 

This program still needs improvments
